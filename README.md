* Postorder sequence and inorder sequence

# length-of-shortest-path
Let 𝑇 be a tree with root 𝑣. The edges of 𝑇 are undirected. Edge in 𝑇 has a nonnegative length. Write a C++ function to determine the length of the shortest paths 
from 𝑣 to the remaining vertices of 𝑇. Your function should have complexity O(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of vertices in 𝑇. Show that this is the case.

# rat-maze
1. Load “maze.txt” to build a maze for the rat.
2. The maze was constructed by a 17 x 17 matrix.
3. Zeros represent the open path and ones are barriers.
4. Four directions (right -> down -> up -> left) are given and
the movements of the rat must follow the order.
5. The rat should start its journey from and end at open path
points.
6. Output the journey of the rat.
